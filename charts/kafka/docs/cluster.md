# Cluster

Use `architecture=cluster` for production-oriented Kafka deployments that need dedicated KRaft controllers, replicated internal topics, and broker redundancy.

## What this mode does

- deploys a dedicated controller quorum through its own StatefulSet
- deploys dedicated brokers through a separate StatefulSet
- uses stable per-pod DNS for controller quorum bootstrap and broker advertised listeners
- uses replicated internal-topic defaults based on broker replica count

## Recommended baseline

- `cluster.controllers.replicaCount=3`
- `cluster.brokers.replicaCount=3`
- `cluster.minInSyncReplicas=2`
- persistent storage on both controllers and brokers
- `pdb.enabled=true`

## Non-goals of v1

- ZooKeeper mode
- external listeners and load balancer matrices
- TLS and SASL/ACL automation
- Kafka Connect, MirrorMaker, Schema Registry, or UI bundles

## Validation before production

1. confirm the controllers and brokers all reach `Ready`
2. create a topic and confirm replication succeeds
3. produce and consume through the bootstrap service
4. validate pod rescheduling with persistent volumes in the target cluster
