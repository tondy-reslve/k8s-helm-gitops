# Valkey Sentinel

## When to use

Use `sentinel` when the application or client can query Sentinel to discover the current primary.

Common cases:

- HA with primary discovery
- Sentinel-compatible clients
- need for failover without adopting Valkey Cluster

## What this architecture delivers

- role-neutral Valkey data nodes (`<release>-valkey-node`)
- dedicated Sentinel pods scaled independently (`<release>-valkey-sentinel`)
- configurable quorum
- primary discovery exclusively through the Sentinel service

## What it requires from the client

- the client must support Valkey Sentinel
- the application must tolerate primary changes discovered through Sentinel
- do not rely on a fixed `-primary` Service; the elected master can run on any `-node-N` pod after failover

## Environment requirements

- at least 3 Sentinel instances for consistent quorum
- enough data nodes to fail over without losing service
- distribution across nodes or zones to reduce correlated failure
- validated client and library behavior before production rollout

## How to think about this topology

`sentinel` is the right option when you want automatic failover without moving to the Valkey Cluster contract.
It keeps one active primary at a time and uses Sentinels for election, health observation, and replica promotion.
Data node pod names are role-neutral: `-node-0` is only the seed master at cold start, not a permanent primary identity.

## Common risks

- choosing a quorum incompatible with the number of Sentinels
- concentrating Sentinels and data nodes on the same node
- using clients that do not discover the primary correctly
- treating Sentinel as a substitute for sharding
- coupling Sentinel count to data node count (not required in this chart)

## Production best practices

- keep 3 Sentinels as the minimum baseline
- use majority quorum
- distribute Sentinels and data nodes across failure domains
- enable `pdb.enabled=true`
- validate real failover and application reconnect timing
- monitor primary changes, replication lag, and Sentinel health

## Best practices

- use at least 3 Sentinels
- keep `quorum` aligned with the number of Sentinels
- distribute Sentinels and data nodes across distinct nodes
- enable `pdb.enabled=true`
- validate failover behavior in the real environment

## Most relevant values

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `architecture` | Must be `sentinel` |
| `node.replicaCount` | Number of Valkey data nodes (use >= 2 for data HA) |
| `node.persistence.enabled` | Data node PVCs (default `false`; peer discovery keeps topology safe without PVCs) |
| `sentinel.replicaCount` | Number of Sentinel pods (independent of data nodes) |
| `sentinel.masterSet` | Master set name that Sentinel clients use for primary discovery |
| `sentinel.quorum` | Quorum for failover decisions |
| `pdb.enabled` | Protection against planned disruption |
| `metrics.enabled` | Exporter for monitoring |

## Example

```yaml
architecture: sentinel

auth:
  enabled: true
  existingSecret: valkey-auth
  existingSecretPasswordKey: valkey-password

node:
  replicaCount: 3

sentinel:
  replicaCount: 3
  masterSet: mymaster
  quorum: 2
```

Decoupled sizing (2 data nodes + 3 Sentinels):

```yaml
architecture: sentinel

node:
  replicaCount: 2

sentinel:
  replicaCount: 3
  quorum: 2
```

## Resilience and trade-offs

### Default: persistence disabled

`node.persistence.enabled` defaults to `false`. Data nodes use `emptyDir` for `/data`.
Anti-split-brain safety does not depend on the bootstrap marker surviving reschedules.
When Sentinel is unreachable, each node probes peer `INFO replication` before choosing a role.

Without additional safeguards, a single restart of the active master pod inside the
`down-after-milliseconds` window would resume it as an empty master and make every
replica full-resync from an empty dataset. The chart mitigates this with
`sentinel.gracefulFailover` (preStop-triggered failover on voluntary disruptions) and
`sentinel.startupFailoverGuard` (a fresh master refuses to resume while peers still
hold data and forces a failover first). Residual data loss remains possible if these
guards are disabled, if no replica is promotable, or if every data node restarts at
the same time. Enable `node.persistence.enabled=true` when you need RDB/AOF to
survive pod reschedules.

### Fail-closed with persistence enabled

When persistence is enabled and a node was already bootstrapped, it refuses to start as an
unconfirmed master if neither Sentinel nor any peer can confirm the current topology.
The pod exits with code 1 (CrashLoopBackOff) until Sentinel quorum or peer discovery succeeds.
This is a safety-over-availability trade-off.

A prolonged Sentinel quorum outage can block restarts of persisted nodes until Sentinels recover.

### Hostname discovery

Sentinel is configured with `resolve-hostnames yes` and `announce-hostnames yes`.
`sentinel get-master-addr-by-name mymaster` returns stable pod hostnames instead of ephemeral IPs.

### HA prerequisites

- `node.replicaCount >= 2` for data-plane HA (at least one replica to promote)
- `sentinel.replicaCount >= 3` with `sentinel.quorum` aligned to the Sentinel count
- `pdb.enabled=true` for planned disruption protection
- spread Sentinels and data nodes across failure domains

## End-to-end validation (k3d)

Run on a lab cluster before production rollout. Shell bootstrap logic is not covered by helm unittest.

1. Install with default values (`node.persistence.enabled=false`) and wait for Ready pods.
2. Resolve the master via Sentinel and write a test key.
3. Delete the current master pod; confirm another `-node-N` is promoted and the key survives.
4. Scale Sentinel to 0 or block Sentinel traffic; delete and recreate `-node-0`.
   Confirm it joins as replica (no double master) via peer discovery.
5. After Sentinels recover, confirm `get-master-addr-by-name` returns a hostname, not a pod IP.

## When to move to another mode

- move back to `replication` if the application cannot operate with Sentinel
- move to `cluster` when the primary need becomes shard-based scale rather than failover
